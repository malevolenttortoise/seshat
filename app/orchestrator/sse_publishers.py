"""
SSE publisher helpers — pure functions + thin state wrappers that
convert backend events into `sse_broadcast.publish` calls.

Kept out of `budget_watcher.py` and the other hot loops so the diff /
transition logic stays unit-testable without dragging in a fake qBit
and a full `DispatcherDeps`.

Conventions:
  * `diff_torrent_progress(prev, curr)` returns the list of events to
    publish; the caller is responsible for awaiting `publish()`.
  * `_client_reachable` / `_last_torrent_snapshot` are module-global
    per-process state. That matches the single-user model — if we ever
    run two budget watcher loops in one process we have a bigger
    problem than SSE dupe events.
